# Markdown and Including Multiple Files

This repository contains some simple test data associated with a question
about [including multiple files with Markdown][1] on Stack Overflow.

If you're interested in trying this out, just clone the repository and execute
the command `pandoc *.md > markdown_book.html` in the root directory of the
repo.  Note that you will end up including this README in the final output,
but I haven't included it in the version that I've checked into this
repository.  (Also note that for this to work, you'll need the [Pandoc][2]
installed on your system.)
